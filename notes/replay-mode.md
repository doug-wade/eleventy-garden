I really like [[activitypub]] apps like Lemmy and Mastodon because I can script against the public with no key, which allows me to write fun web tools.

One web tool I would like would be a "replay mode" for events. I watch a lot of sports, and participate in a lot of live discussions with people while watching those sports. I would like a website that allows me to "replay" a live sports event, and see the tweets synced with the event as I'm watching it.
